Intro: 
- Purs goals are instant money settlements, lower fees, and going completely digital
- Hackathon Prompt: Creating a cutting-edge mobile payment experience 
Tips: 
- Don't mock something that demonstrates our core idea 
- Make the experience pop out 
- The app should be blazing fast 

Parameters from Purs: 
	- Merchant Device => Android Phone 
	- Customer Device => Any standard smartphone 
	- Information flow => up to us 


Potential Ideas from Purs: 
	- Wallet QR Code + Front-Facing Camera 
		- Concerns
		    - Easy to put QR code in apple wallet? 
		    - Android support? 
		    - QR code static? Fraud Risk 
	- NFC Tap using Host Card Emulation 
		- Customer device basically scans merchant device (similar to how you use apple pay on some tablets at some stores)
		- Concerns 
			- Distance Filtering 
			- Easy for consumer to setup <= this seems to be a recurring 
	- Telegram Client Supporting
		- Purs payment 
		- Purs mobile ordering 
		- Similar to a discord bot or telegram bot 
	- AI Mobile ordering 
		- Users could talk to Purs app and place a mobile order through Siri/ Google Assistant 
		- We had this idea but decided it's not best go this route. 
	- NFC Tag (NDEF)
		- Similar to RFID tags (think RFID tags, if you don't know RFID it's how OSU student IDs let you get into dorms)
		- So customer device taps NFC tag, and NFC tag is commutating to merchant device 
		- Example given was somebody taps the device, then sets an amount to request, then next person to tap device is prompted to send money
		- Opposite of credit cards in a sense, for example if somebody steals the tag, you couldn't steal money, you would be sending money.
